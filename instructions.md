#Core Functionalities
1. User should be able to record his voice through a record button on the homescreen.
2. The voice note should be transcribed by OpenAI Whisper and that should be used to extract the to-dos and ideas from it.(ONly if the voice not has both).
3. Two sections - todo and ideas - should have the ai generated todos. Should be an overall list and not specific lists for each voice note.
